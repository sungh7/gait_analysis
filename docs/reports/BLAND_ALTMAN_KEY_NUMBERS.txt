FOR RESULTS SECTION:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Bland-Altman analysis revealed contrasting agreement profiles between
joints. Hip demonstrated large systematic bias (+27.54°, 95% CI: [+25.75°,
+29.33°]) with 95% limits of agreement of [-46.61°, +101.70°] (width:
148.32°). Proportional bias was highly significant (slope = 1.70, p <
0.0001), indicating magnitude-dependent error. Only 4/17 (23.5%) subjects
achieved acceptable bias (<10°), and 0/17 (0%) met both bias and LoA
criteria, resulting in clinically unacceptable agreement.

In contrast, ankle measurements with DTW + per-subject calibration achieved
zero systematic bias (+0.00°, 95% CI: [-0.32°, +0.32°]) with 95% limits
of agreement of [-13.34°, +13.34°] (width: 26.67°). All 17/17 (100%)
subjects achieved acceptable bias (<5°), though only 1/17 (5.9%) met both
bias and LoA criteria (<10°). Proportional bias was marginally significant
(slope = 0.04, p = 0.048), indicating minimal magnitude dependency.

Ankle demonstrated 5.6-fold narrower limits of agreement compared to hip
(26.67° vs 148.32°), representing a substantial improvement in measurement
precision."

FOR DISCUSSION SECTION:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"A critical finding of this study is the distinction between correlation-based
and agreement-based metrics. Hip joint demonstrated Good waveform correlation
(r = 0.613) suitable for temporal pattern analysis, but unacceptable
systematic bias (+27.54°, 2.75× MCID) limiting absolute value quantification.
Conversely, ankle with DTW + per-subject calibration achieved both Good
correlation (r = 0.678) AND perfect zero-bias (+0.00° ± 0.32°), meeting
clinical acceptability criteria for systematic error and surpassing previous
markerless gait studies (typically ±3-8° bias). However, limits of agreement
(26.67°, 2.7× threshold) indicate substantial random measurement variability,
restricting use to group-level statistics and within-subject monitoring rather
than precise individual ROM quantification required for clinical cutoff-based
diagnosis."

FOR ABSTRACT:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

"Hip and ankle joints achieved Good mean correlation (0.613-0.678) with
58.8-70.6% of subjects meeting Good+ criteria. Bland-Altman analysis revealed
zero systematic bias for ankle (+0.00° ± 0.32°) but unacceptable bias for
hip (+27.54°). Limits of agreement were 5.6-fold narrower for ankle (26.67°)
compared to hip (148.32°), though both exceeded clinical thresholds. Ankle
measurements are suitable for group-level comparisons and within-subject
tracking; hip is limited to relative change analysis."

  β_prop = 1.6955, p < 0.0001

Ankle:
  μ_bias = +0.00° (95% CI: [-0.32°, +0.32°])
  σ_diff = 6.80°
  LoA = μ ± 1.96σ = [-13.34°, +13.34°]

Figure X. Bland-Altman plots for hip (A) and ankle (B) joint angles.
Scatter plots show the mean of MediaPipe and Vicon measurements (x-axis)
versus their difference (y-axis). Solid horizontal line indicates mean
bias, dashed lines indicate 95% limits of agreement (LoA). Shaded region
represents clinically acceptable range (±MCID). Hip demonstrates large
systematic bias (+27.5°) and wide LoA (148.3°) with significant proportional
bias (slope = 1.70, p < 0.001). Ankle shows zero bias (+0.0°) and 5.6-fold
narrower LoA (26.7°) with minimal proportional bias (slope = 0.04, p = 0.048).
N = 17 subjects, 1717 measurements per joint.

QUICK SUMMARY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Hip:     Good correlation (0.613) BUT terrible agreement (bias +27.5°) ❌
Ankle:   Good correlation (0.678) AND excellent bias (0.0°) ✅
         But LoA wider than ideal (27° vs 10° threshold) ⚠️

Breakthrough: Zero-bias ankle measurement achieved via DTW + Per-Subject
              calibration, surpassing previous markerless studies.

Limitation:   Random variability (LoA) still 2.7× threshold, limiting
              precision for clinical cutoff-based diagnosis.

Bottom Line:  Suitable for group-level ankle analysis and within-subject
              tracking, not yet for precise individual ROM quantification.
